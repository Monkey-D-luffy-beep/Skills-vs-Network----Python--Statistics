# Skills-vs-Network----Python--Statistics
📊 Skills vs Network – Python Statistics
This project visually and statistically explores the impact of Skills and Networking on job-hunting success, using Python-based data visualization and statistical techniques.

🔍 Objective
To demonstrate and analyze how different combinations of skills and network strength affect job opportunities using:

Quadrant Analysis

Normalized Bell Curve

Z-Score-based Success Mapping

📈 Visualizations in matplotlib

⚗️ Optionally extending to hypothesis testing (ANOVA, Chi-square, etc.)

🧠 Logic Behind the Quadrants
Case	Skill Level	Network Strength	Expected Success
1	Low	Weak	Minimum
2	High	Weak	Still Difficult
4	Low	Strong	Better than 1 & 2
3	High	Strong	Highest (God Tier)

We visualize these cases in a 2D quadrant and a normalized bell curve, mapping their relative success likelihoods using Z-scores:

Case 1 → 0.1

Case 2 → 0.5

Case 4 → 0.7

Case 3 → 1.0

📈 Visualizations
2D Quadrant Plot: Shows skill vs network strength and classifies four logical cases.

Bell Curve Mapping: Plots each case on a normalized distribution to visualize relative advantage.

Statistical Readiness: Prepares groundwork for applying statistical tests like ANOVA and Chi-square.
